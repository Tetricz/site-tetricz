Heaven and Earth are used to refer to everything. The child is the child of everything. Everything will and tries to protect/nurture the child with the exception of things with free will. The child's life will be filled with a shit ton of emotions. Ex (grief, sorrow, joy, desire, irritation). Maslow's hierarchy of needs should be included in this series as a main theme
