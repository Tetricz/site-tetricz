## Hobbies

Some of my personal hobbies are self-hosting and decentralized systems.  
I have had a particular interest in [Storj DCS](https://www.storj.io) as of late. In fact this site itself is being hosted using storj as the host and cloudflare for DNS. 

Amateur fantasy writer, go check out my poorly attempted writing.

## My journey into Computer Science

At a young age I started playing Video games. This developed a love of video games and in particular has created a vested interest in Automation and Computer Science.  

I was always interested in Minecraft because it had Redstone and some automation. I loved utilizing the games mechanics to pursue automated farms and cool contraptions with or without a purpose.
In 2017 and there was another game that came out and increased my desire for automation, <font color="red">**Factorio**</font>. Best game to ever be made in my opinion. This was the final step I took before really investing time into
Computer Science as anything other than a passing hobby.
