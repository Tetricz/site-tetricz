## Hobbies

Some of my personal hobbies are self-hosting and decentralized systems.  
I have had a particular interest in [Storj DCS](https://www.storj.io) as of late. In fact this site itself is being hosted using storj as the host and cloudflare for DNS.  

## My journey into Computer Science

From a young age I've been playing Video games. This love of video games and in particular Minecraft has created a vested interest in Automation and Computer Science.  

I was always interested in Redstone and the automation aspect in Minecraft. I loved utilizing the games mechanics to pursue automated farms and greater efficient yeilds. All so that I could eventually let the game run itself...  
Eventually I ran out of things to automate, not that I don't still play Minecraft, there's just so much I've already automated that I only use it for more artistic outlets now.  

Thankfully the year was 2017 and there was another game coming about that could endlessly satisfy my desire for automation **Factorio**. Best game to ever be made in my opinion. This was the final step I took before really investing time into
Computer Science as anything other than a passing hobby.
