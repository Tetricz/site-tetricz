## Education

* Associates in Computer Science from Lone Star College
* Undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Hosuton

## Interests

I have a particular interest in distributed systems. I have had a particular interest in [Storj DCS](https://www.storj.io) as of late. In fact this site itself is using storj as the file host and cloudflare for site hosting.

My favorite language to write in is Rust, and it's a pity that none of my University assignments allowed me to utilize it.

## Goals

I hope to someday be able to get a Doctorate in Computer Science, but first I need the money or a company willing to sponsor my education.
Eventually I would like to be a Software Engineer working on distributed systems. Either something decentralized or on some sort of cloud infrastructure.

## Learning Goals

* Learn more about distributed systems (always)
* Rust (Specialize in it)
* Qwik Framework
* Build Systems (Interested in making my own to learn more about how they work)
