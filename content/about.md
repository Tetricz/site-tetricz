## Interests

I have a particular interest in distributed systems. I have had a particular interest in [Storj DCS](https://www.storj.io) as of late. In fact this site itself is using storj as the file host and cloudflare for site hosting.

My favorite language to write in is Rust, and it's a pity that none of my University assignments allowed me to utilize it.
