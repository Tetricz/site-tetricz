## V1 - The beginnings

Initially the site was made very poorly by myself in high school.
It was very basic and only used the most simple HTML and CSS I knew at the time.
It was nothing more than a quick little project I made for one of my computer classes.  

You can find a copy of this [here](https://www.tetricz.com/archive/v1/).

## V2 - For some class

This version was a nice little template that I had made for use in a class.  
I thought about completely reworking it into an actual template, but I honestly can't say that I want to finish it. I don't like the color scheme and the layout is a bit funky. There is a chance that [V2](https://www.tetricz.com/archive/v2/) may someday become a complete template, maybe even for Zola. Who knows? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Current - Made with hermit_zola template

I found this template by chance one day while browsing the internet looking at things that convert markdown into static sites.
The template looked nice enough and I felt it would be best to switch to something that looked professional until I actually make something that is professional looking myself.  

In the end, I am happy with this template and will likely use it to Document my various projects.
