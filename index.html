                    My dream job is to be a software engineer working on embedded systems. I would primarily like to be on the software portion of embedded systems. I have a particular interest in Rust and have started teaching myself the language.
                    I have a few projects that I'm working on to gain personal experience with embedded systems.

                    Some of my personal hobbies are self-hosting and decentralized systems. I have a particular interest in <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://www.storj.io">Storj DCS</a>.
                    This site itself is being hosted using storj as the host and cloudflare for DNS.
                    From a young age I've been playing Video games. This love of video games and in particular Minecraft has created a vested interest in self-hosting. I wanted to host my own stuff on my own homelab server.
                    Whether it be a media server, cloud storage, or game servers for my friends and I. I love to read fiction and someday want to publish my own book. Just as I love to read fiction I also like to watch, I find myself
                    watching anime, sci-fi and fantasy tv shows often.

                    My main goal for this class is to end up with a full on CRUD(create, read, update, delete) project. One that I will be able to show off in my resume and possibly use in the future.

                    Career/Education goals for this year are to get some experience in the Computer Science field.
                    Then try to get an internship lined up for next year and a part time job this year in either IT or some other related field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some personal goals for me are to lose weight and get into better health than I currently am.
                    This means I need to change my diet and start working out religiously. I also want to read more books this year than last.
                    I only read around 6 last year, but I'm hoping to read one book a month at least this year.
